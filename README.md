# learning_start
I started trying different stuff randomly. So there is no existence of some project kind of thing. I tried some script, copy pasted many 
of them and tried to push them to a newly created github repo. If you don't find anything here useful or helpful to you, don't try to find
something. Just move on to some others work.
